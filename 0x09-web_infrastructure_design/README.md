## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and understanding various aspects of web infrastructure, DevOps, and system administration. The project consists of three tasks that gradually increase in complexity, requiring the design of web infrastructures and explanations of the roles of different components.

## Project Timeline
- Start Date: August 24, 2023, 6:00 AM
- End Date: August 28, 2023, 6:00 AM

## Tasks

### Task 0: Simple Web Stack
In this task, we design a basic web infrastructure hosted on a single server. The components include a web server (Nginx), an application server, a codebase, and a database (MySQL). The infrastructure should be reachable via www.foobar.com.

### Task 1: Distributed Web Infrastructure
For this task, we design a more complex web infrastructure hosted on three servers. The components include a web server (Nginx), an application server, a load balancer (HAproxy), a codebase, and a database (MySQL). The aim is to introduce concepts of load balancing and high availability.

### Task 2: Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure
In the final task, we design a secure, encrypted, and monitored web infrastructure. Components include firewalls, an SSL certificate for HTTPS, and monitoring clients. The goal is to understand security considerations and monitoring practices.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, we aim to achieve the following learning objectives:
- Explain the roles of different components in a web infrastructure.
- Design web infrastructures of varying complexity.
- Identify potential issues and limitations in different designs.
- Understand the importance of security, encryption, and monitoring in web infrastructure.

## How to Use This Repository
Each task's solution can be found in the respective directory. You'll find diagrams, explanations, and screenshots that demonstrate our understanding of the concepts covered in the project.
