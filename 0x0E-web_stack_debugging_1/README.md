# 0x0E-web_stack_debugging_1

This repository contains solutions for tasks related to web stack debugging using Bash scripts.

## Task 0: Nginx likes port 80

The goal of this task is to ensure that Nginx is running and listening on port 80. A Bash script (`0-nginx_likes_port_80`) has been provided to automate this task.

To use the script:
1. Make it executable with `chmod +x 0-nginx_likes_port_80`.
2. Run the script with `./0-nginx_likes_port_80`.

## Task 1: Make it sweet and short

In this advanced task, we aim to create a concise Bash script (`1-debugging_made_short`) that ensures Nginx is not running. The script is limited to 5 lines and should make `service nginx status` report that Nginx is not running.

To use the script:
1. Make it executable with `chmod +x 1-debugging_made_short`.
2. Run the script with `./1-debugging_made_short`.

**Note:** Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions and environment set up to run these scripts successfully.
